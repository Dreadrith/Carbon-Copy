**Carbon Copy** is a feature-rich constraint-based clone system built for **VRChat** users and designed with performers in mind. Its features are entirely customizable and modular while optimizing parameter memory, and can be installed with one-click without any VRChat 3.0 or advanced Unity experience whatsoever.

With the earliest prototypes/teasers of the system dating back to 2020, we've spent over a year polishing these features for you...

## Available now on [gumroad](https://dreadrith.gumroad.com/)!

To use **Jutsu Control**, the mapping is the same as the **Gesture Control** mapping above, but with two additional combo gestures to remember:

| Jutsu Function | Gesture Combination |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| `Trigger Gesture` | Both hands Victory |
| `Reset Gesture` | Both hands Rock n Roll |

Gestures will be ignored until the `Trigger Gesture` is activated. Once the `Trigger Gesture` is activated, the next corresponding gesture to the **Gesture Control** mapping will be toggled, and persist after letting go of the gesture. To clear all active **Gesture Control**s, use `Reset Gesture`

# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Is Carbon Copy compatible with VRChat Quest Avatars? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

**No**, as [VRChat Quest Avatars](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/quest-content-limitations) do not support Constraints at this time. Other clone systems are often not compatible either.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> Is Carbon Copy compatible with Optimized Avatars? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

It is not compatible by default, but manual modifications can be made to reach [optimization standards](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/avatar-performance-ranking-system). It is possible to get down as far as Good rating, assuming you had a near Excellent rating model prior to clone generation. You would have to remove the HUD mesh, and modify the `Show Self` and `Hide Self` animation clips to matswap your body mesh to an invisible material instead of toggling the body mesh to prevent yourself from being permanently culled. Any other stat reductions are dependent on what avatar you choose to use with this system.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> How do I fix No Gesture Expressions to also disable non-blendshapes (Tongues/Eyes)? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Navigate through your project files to your Avatar's Generated Assets folder for Carbon Copy and locate the animation clips for `Gesture` and `Jutsu` in the UI folder. You can add extra properties to this clip to account for resetting your non-blendshape animations.

</details>

<details>

  <summary> <strong> How do I export Carbon Copy with my commercial package? </strong> </summary>

######

<blockquote>

Assuming you have a **commercial license** for Carbon Copy, you will want to export the respective Generated Assets folder and the Icons folder for Carbon Copy alongside the rest of your avatar package.

You can find these generated resources at ***Save File Path**/GeneratedAssets/*. By default, this is *Assets/DreadScripts/Carbon Copy/GeneratedAssets/*.

The folder for the icons can be found at *Assets/DreadScripts/Carbon Copy/Icons*.
